# Overview

In this project I wanted to know where all the capitals in world are. So my goal for this project is to use GIS Mapping to accomplish this task. I will use Visual Studio as my IDE, Javascript, HTML, and CSS as my programming languages.

For this project I used sample code from [ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/) and added my own code to it. I used JavaScript code I got from [ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/) and added my own code to it. My program reads a JSON file of countries and their capitals and the coordinates of their capitals (latitude and longitude) and plots the coordinates on a map. The code is designed in a way to plot indiviual points every half a second, so you can visually see the program plotting points as a human would in real life.

My purpose for this software is to learn the GIS environment and solve a real life curiousity I had. This programming can also be used for educational purposes which would making learning courtries names, their locations, and many more.

# Development Environment

The tool I used to create this project was Microsofts Viusal Studio which is an integrated development environment from Microsoft.

The languages used in this project were:

* JavaScript - is a high- level programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
* HTML - HyperText Markup Language is the basic buildiong blocks for web applications.
* CSS - Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for prensentation of markup languages such as HTML.
